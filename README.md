## 👋 Hey there, I'm Djamal!

🛩️ **Aviation enthusiast**, marathon runner, and global traveler—so if you want to chat about cultural leadership practices or the best running trails around the world, I’m all ears! I love discovering new places, indulging in diverse cuisines, and geeking out over aviation technology. When I'm not on the move, you can find me enjoying a good book or indulging in some good tech jokes.

🚀 I started my journey as a developer and gradually transitioned into a **leadership role**, focusing on managing engineering teams, optimizing software delivery pipelines, and leading architecture transformations. But I still **code when I can**, whether it’s experimenting with new tech, automating workflows, or contributing to small side projects.

### 🔍 **Things I enjoy & update occasionally**
- 🏃 Running marathons and exploring scenic trails  
- 🌍 Traveling and experiencing different cultures  
- 💻 Coding when I find the time, usually automating things or experimenting with DevOps & AI  
- 📂 Writing about **cloud, DevOps, and automation** (when I feel like it)
